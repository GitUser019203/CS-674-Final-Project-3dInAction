The dfaust, ikeaactio, and ikeago folders each have their own custom train and run scripts for quick testing. 

These folders can be referenced when modifying train.py, test.py, and evaluation.py in the project root folder.

Or you can move the dfaust, ikeaactio, or ikeago folders into project root and run them individually.
    Note: If you do this, you may get errors and may have to disable some of the imports as they are referencing models in the models folder that have been archived.
